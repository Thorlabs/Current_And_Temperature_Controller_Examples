## Example: MTDx Temperature Controller with Pyvisa

This sample code shows how you can control a Thorlabs MTD415L, MTD415LE, MTD415T,	MTD415TE,	or MTD1020T.

The code connects to the controller, sets several parameters and measures the current temperature.

It uses the Pyvisa library, which needs to be installed separately on the computer.
