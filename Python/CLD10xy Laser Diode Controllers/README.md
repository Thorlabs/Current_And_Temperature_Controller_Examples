## CLD Compact Laser Diode Controller Open and Control

This sample code shows how you can control a Thorlabs CLD laser diode controller in Python. It uses the PyVISA library to send SCPI commands to the controller and make or read settings on it.

Please note that the resource name (“USB0::0x1313::…”) in the sample code needs to be adjusted to the used controller type and unit.
